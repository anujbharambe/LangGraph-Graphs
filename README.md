# LangGraph-Graphs

This repository showcases the fundamental building blocks and flow control techniques in LangGraph. Each module in this repository demonstrates a specific pattern or concept using LangGraph's graph-based approach to programming with LLMs.

## 🔗 Projects Overview

### 1. `HelloWorld.py`
A basic demonstration of creating a simple LangGraph that outputs "Hello, World!" — the traditional first program for any language or framework.

### 2. `Looping.py`
Illustrates how to implement looping within a LangGraph. A node is called repeatedly until a specified condition is met.

### 3. `Multiple_inputs.py`
Explores handling multiple input sources and how they can be passed and merged through the graph.

### 4. `Conditional_Agent.py`
Demonstrates how LangGraph can implement conditional execution — certain nodes activate based on dynamic decisions made during runtime.

### 5. `Sequential_Agent.py`
Shows a linear flow where each step is executed in sequence, perfect for structured pipelines such as data processing or form-filling tasks.
