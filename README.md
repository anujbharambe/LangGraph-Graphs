# ðŸ“˜ Graph Projects 

## Overview
These introduce foundational graph-based projects, emphasizing the use of LangGraph for constructing conversational AI workflows.

## Projects Covered

### 1. Basic Graph Construction
- **Objective**: Understand the fundamentals of creating nodes and edges using LangGraph.
- **Key Concepts**: Graph theory basics, node definitions, edge connections.

### 2. Conditional Routing
- **Objective**: Implement decision-making within the graph based on user inputs.
- **Key Concepts**: Conditional edges, user input handling, dynamic flow control.

### 3. Looping Mechanisms
- **Objective**: Introduce loops to handle repetitive tasks or queries.
- **Key Concepts**: Loop constructs, iteration control, exit conditions.

### 4. Error Handling in Graphs
- **Objective**: Manage exceptions and ensure robust graph execution.
- **Key Concepts**: Try-catch blocks, fallback nodes, error propagation.

## Tools & Technologies
- **LangGraph**: Primary library for graph construction.
- **Python**: Programming language used for scripting and implementation.

## Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
pip install langgraph
```

### Basic Usage
```python
import langgraph

# Define nodes
def start():
    return "Hello, how can I assist you?"

def end():
    return "Goodbye!"

# Create graph
graph = langgraph.Graph()
graph.add_node("start", start)
graph.add_node("end", end)
graph.add_edge("start", "end")

# Execute graph
graph.run("start")
```
