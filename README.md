Tools & Technologies
LangGraph: Primary library for graph construction.

Python: Programming language used for scripting and implementation.

Getting Started
Installation:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install langgraph
Basic Usage:

python
Copy
Edit
import langgraph

# Define nodes
def start():
    return "Hello, how can I assist you?"

def end():
    return "Goodbye!"

# Create graph
graph = langgraph.Graph()
graph.add_node("start", start)
graph.add_node("end", end)
graph.add_edge("start", "end")

# Execute graph
graph.run("start")
